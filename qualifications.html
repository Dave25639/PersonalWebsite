        <h2>Teamwork and Communication</h2>
        <p>
          Years of collaboration with friends, and classmates have taught me the value of communication and
          teamwork. In areas where I am qualified, I like to take the lead and
          divide the workload in a way that plays to each group member's
          strengths. I am an excellent listener and will try to hear every
          members opinion before making an important decision, such as whether
          or not we should use one framework over another.
        </p>
        <p>
          In situations where I am not the most knowledgable, I like to play the
          role of the advisor while working had to learn and reach a higher
          level of competence in whatever it is my group may be working on.
          Also, because I am seeing the problem from a not yet informed
          perspective, I always make sure to question the choices being made
          rather than blindly follow orders in order to make sure we are making
          the best choice and so that I can see the reasoning behind why each
          choice was made that way.
