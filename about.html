        <p>
          I am currently a senior at Texas A&M, studying computer science. I particularly enjoy
          topics such as high performance and multi-core computing, networking and distributed systems,
          machine learning, and data science. I hope to use my skills to create software capable of harnessing
          the full potential of computer hardware.

        <h2>I have hobbies.</h2>
        <p>
          In my free time I enjoy listening to music, watching movies and anime, and playing
          bass guitar. I also like to learn about fashion, architecture, and design in my free time.
          Rock climbing, hiking, and travelling to new places are pretty cool too.
