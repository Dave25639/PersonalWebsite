        <h2 style="margin-top: 0px">Computer Science Tutoring</h2>
        <p>
          What began my journey into volunteer work was a sudden opportunity
          that was presented to me in class. I was a sophomore in high school at
          the time, taking my third computer science class when my teacher Mr.
          May told the class that due to family issues, one of the computer
          science teachers teaching the freshman level computer science course
          had to take an unexpected leave of absence. Of course, a substitute
          teacher could easily be found, but it proved to be exceptionally
          difficult to find one with prior coding experience, which meant that
          the entire class of students were left to fend for themselves,
          battling squiggly red lines and compilation errors. Mr. May knew that
          without guidance, these students would not be able to keep up,
          especially with a subject like computer science which builds upon
          itself. Without a solid foundation of knowledge, it can be very hard
          to progress. When I imagined these poor souls continuing their
          journeys having to consult stack overflow (ChatGPT has no been
          invented yet unfortunately), I knew that I had to do something about
          it.

          After being assigned to a timeslot, I began my work and was greeted
          with a room full of conversation and energy. As you might expect, the
          idea of having a long-term substitute teacher excited them. You could
          practically see the evil plots forming in their head on how to take
          advantage of the change in leadership, but luckily, us tutors were
          there to intervene. You see, one thing we quickly learned was that as
          long as you're able to provide students with assignments at a fitting
          level of difficulty and help with clearing up roadblocks that arise
          during the software devlopment process, they become genuinely excited
          to learn the content, ask questions, and try new things. As a tutor, I
          always sought to balance the task of giving them a good enough hint to
          help them continue onwards while simultaneosly obscuring the direct
          answer in order to facilitate the learning process. Throw in a little
          bit of humor and conversation here and there, and soon it was as if
          the teacher had never left.

        <h2>Texas Humane Heroes Volunteering</h2>
        <p>
          One fateful Winter day, I turned 16. I checked a checkbox to indicate
          that I was 16 or older, then hit the submit button on my application
          to become a volunteer at Texas Humane Heroes at precisely 12:03 AM. In
          six months I wanted to volunteer at the shelter to take some work off
          the shoulders of the hard workers there, and over time more and more
          animals ended up needing a bit of help finding a new home.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first day was a disaster. I was quarantined to a building
          designated for sick animals, specifically young kittens prone to
          ringworm infection. A quick trip to google search images instilled a
          deep sense of nauseous paranoia but I put on my Personal Protective
          Equipment and got to work, the little guys needed someone to do the
          job.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next day I was offered the choice to work at some other station,
          but I refused. Being a lazy immature kid, I had never worked a day in
          my life until now. So to make up for it I sacrificed myself for the
          sake of the other workers and cleaned the kitten rehabilitation ward
          almost every time I went. There also happened to be a particularly
          cute kitten who would try to snag my disposable robe everytime I
          walked by his cage but that's unrelated to my decision.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the end of my service I emerged with ammonia-singed nostrils and a
          realization that I was a cat person. They know how to mind their own
          business and don't suck up to you for attention with little tricks and
          sometimes like to be thrown onto matresses, running back for another
          toss (she likes it I swear). Later I came back and adopted two cats
          that live in my household now, they're pretty chill.
